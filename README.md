# Data Visualization - US Flight Delays

## Summary
in no more than 4 sentences, briefly introduce your data visualization and add any context that can help readers understand it

*Is there a relationship between time of day, day of week and the time delay for flights?* By looking at the [Rita Flight dataset]() we can explore any relationship that might exist between

## Design
explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback

### Selecting the dataset
For this data

## Feedback
include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization

### First interview
> What do the colors of the first graphic mean?
Both graphs below don't clearly show the relationship they are tying to show, it takes time to understand.
I liked a lot the interaction that both small graphs have.
What does DepDelay mean?
The graph in the bottom left does not have units of the time being measured (months, days, years)?
What is the purpose of the graphs?
I like the colors and design of the graphs, but I feel they lack context.
Months 5-9 increase DepDelay, surely because of the increased amount of flights in summer time.
