This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
data = read.csv("data/original/2008.csv")

hour = function(x) { return( substr(x, 0, nchar(x)-2)); }
data["Time"] = lapply(hour, data["DepTime"])

library(dyplr)
data = mutate(data, DateTime = paste(Year, Month, DayofMonth, Time, sep="-"))

grouped = group_by(data, DateTime)

summed = summarise(grouped,count=n(), DepDelay=mean(DepDelay))
```
